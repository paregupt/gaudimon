31 hosts in a training cluster, each host with eight Gaudi accelerators (OAMs). All 248 OAMs in good health (shown in green).

Compare to a condition when training failed because one OAM is lost. Find this issue quickly as shown by '247' #OAM in red. Also find the host that lost the card from the table showing 'gaudi-2-33' on the top with only 7 OAMs

Another instance when 1 out of 256 OAM went to a Disabled state (different from being lost).

Training job kept failing after a mins. No obvious reason was found, bit one OAM kept reporting a lot more power usage (1900 W) than the cap (600 W). It could have been a bug with reporting, but replacing this card made the training complete successfully.
